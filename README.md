1. My OpenAI(Chatgpt) api was not working so I moved ahead with opensource LLMs.
2. I have used Ollama and the model named Llama3.1:8b
3. Steps to run this project.
   Open the terminal and do:
       pip install -r requirement.txt
       then, ollama pull llama3.1:8b

   Once these are succesfully installed, then go to terminal and write
         streamlit run app.py


   You have two functionality: Either you can type the message or click on microphone button to speak up.
